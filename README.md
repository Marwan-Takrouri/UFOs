# UFOs


***Overview of the analysis:***

This project is intended to Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, i ’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape for more user interactivity and showcase .

With my help, Dana has assembled code that will not only build a functional table but will add the ability to filter it as well. That's definitely an accomplishment—JavaScript isn't an easy language to get the hang of. But even though she thinks her code is structurally sound and will work without a hitch, she still needs to test it. To do so, it's time to build the HTML page Dana will be showcasing her work on and i am the one who will help her to do so .

She'll need to keep the different ids she created in app.js in mind while she pieces this webpage together. There will be a button (#filter-btn) somewhere as well as a #datetime id nestled into some tags. She'll need to build the base of the table so that the code we helped construct knows where to put the table's data. This means that the columns and rows will all need to be defined manually.

Dana wants to customize her page by adding specific CSS components to the stylesheet, such as applying a background color to the page and adding an image to the jumbotron. Although it's neat and tidy in its current form, it's not very attention-grabbing.








***Results:***

Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Using JavaScript and HTML, we created table filters, that allows to filter through date, city, state, country, and shape. Please refer to the imags below :
